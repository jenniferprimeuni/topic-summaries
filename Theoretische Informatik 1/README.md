# Theoretische Informatik 1

Disclaimer!: This part will be in German as I for some reason have problems with my head doing weird things when I learn this stuff in English. (I do not have a german keyboard tho, so we will not have the things the German language blessed us with like Umlaute)

Disclaimer 2: My Professor is very particular about a lot of things, so this repo is how *my* Professor wants me to do things, take this with a grain of salt.
